# Custom Parametric Filters

This is part of my Masters Thesis research in Digital Signal Processing. The goal is to design 2nd-order parametric digital filters which do not suffer from the "frequency warping" or "digital cramping" issue that persists in the standard bilinear transform derived filters.

> Although the proposed filter's magnitude response closely matches that of the original analog filter, the phase response still differs. In most cases, the difference in phase response will not be perceived.
